# BTC Price ETL Pipeline

## ðŸ”° Overview

This project is a fully working ETL pipeline built with Apache Airflow. It extracts Bitcoin order book snapshots from multiple exchanges, calculates the best price for a given order volume, and loads the results into a PostgreSQL database.

The pipeline demonstrates dynamic task mapping, XCom usage for passing data between tasks, and a clean separation of extract, transform, and load stages.
